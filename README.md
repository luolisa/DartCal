DartCal
=======

The Problem: The Dartmouth quarterly system == 10 week terms. Dartmouth students have to quickly adapt to not only their own academic schedules every term, but also their friends' schedules, on top of mastering the minimal-sensical schedule block diagram. 

The Solution: DartCal, an mobile (currently Android based) application that visualizes overlapping schedule blocks, and free time. 


Developed by three Dartmouth students who are fed up of eating lunch alone and can never remember when those damn 11s end and 2s begin.

By Lisa Luo '15, Will McConnell '15, and Paul Champeau '15.
